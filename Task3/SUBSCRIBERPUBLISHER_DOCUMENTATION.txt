									ROS2 PUBLISHER AND RECIEVER

PREREQUISITES:
	>Ubuntu ISO: Download the Ubuntu ISO file and use a virtual machine (VM) to install and run Ubuntu
	>install ros 2 humble from ros2 humble documentation  (https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html)

For communication we have two nodes subscriber node and publisher
the publisher publish a message to the subscriber

ROS2 ENVIRONMENT SETUP
	create a workspace folder  mkdir -p /workspace/src
     To build completer workspace
	cd /workspace
	colcon build create 3 workspace folders
	build 
	install 
	log  
                                                     
cd /workspace/src
then to create a  package ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_python first_package
this creates a subfolder called first_package
cd first_package
we will create a source file for publisher node
gedit publisher.py
	in the gedit we can write the python code for publisher and specify what message to publiah
(code is pushed in another file called publisher.py in GitHub)
then create another python file using : gedit subscriber.py
here in this code the subscriber will receive the message sent by the publisher

Next in the setup.py file we need to specify the entry points like publisher = <file name>.publisher:main
           subscriber = <file name>.subscriber:main
after this run the publisher and receiver in two different terminals using
ros2 run <filename> publisher
ros2 run <filename> subscriber
this will only work when each time we need to setup the environment  (source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
)

after this we can see the publisher publishing a message(in my case its I am Hassan!!!)
And the subscriber receives the message (I am Hassan!!!)

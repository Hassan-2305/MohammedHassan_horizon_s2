                                                    Turtle sim using ros2 iron

You can check wich are you using by ls /opt/ros


We can check which version of ROS you are using by running:    ls /opt/ros

Environment can be set up by:  source /opt/ros/iron/setup.bash

We can verify if the environmental variables is properly setup by:  printenv | grep -I ROS  {if we see ros version 2 and ros distro iron environment is setup correctly )
 Next to install turtlesim: run sudo apt install ros-iron-turtlesim

to check turtlesim is properly installed: run ros2 pkg executables turtlesim
the output should look like this
 	turtlesim draw_sqaure
 	turtlesim mimic 
 	turtlesim turtlr_teleop_key
 	turtlesim_node

This means that the installation was correct.

To start turtlesim run: ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node
The turtle with a gui is seen.
This will open the turtle's GUI, but the turtle won't move yet because the teleoperation node is not initialized.


To setup a teleoperation node open a new terminal.
But we need to setup the environment for the package to run: (source /opt/ros/iron/setup.bash)

and then run: ros2 run turtlesim turtle teleop key



Behind the scenes
The turtle teleoperation key
keys pressed by user is sent to the turtlesim node and the turtle will move
